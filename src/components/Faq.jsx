            Most typically, they’re organised in order of priority.
            Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of paper or post it notes
            and act as a memory aid. As technology has evolved we have been able
            to create a todo lists with excel spreadsheets, word documents,
            email lists, todo list apps, Microsoft to do and google to do list
            to name a few. You can use a to do list in your home and personal
            life, or in the workplace. Having a list of everything you need to
            do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget anything
            important. By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order
            in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your
            immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little
            later.

          <h2 className="headabout">The Benefits of Using a To Do List</h2>
          <h4 className="paraabout">
            One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is
            that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks
            in a list, they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear
            outline of the tasks you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, it
            helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind for
            other more creative tasks. When you complete a task, you can cross
            it off your list. This gives you a sense of progress and
            achievement, something you’ll lack if you’re always rushing from one
            task to the next. If you feel a sense of achievement, it spurs you
            on and motivates you to keep moving forward.
